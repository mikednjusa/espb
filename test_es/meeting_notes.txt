ElasticSearch Meeting
* get top output for cpu usage
* get df output from centos better
* add option to delete instance in data_file.json
* 

Issues so far:


* Find and collect esrally generated log files.
* Ctrl+C should terminate instances.
* Output last X lines of esrally via a verbosity flag.
  * Verbosity flag should specify amount of output from script to help debug issues.
* On using ES ini, warn the user that the ES endpoint specified must be accessible via test machine.

* DONE: Print out cpu load stats per run.
* DONE: Add user-friendly banners to output (for instance creation, install, and for running test)
* DONE: Collect any logs/zips on failure.


Jan 25th:
* DONE: Handle invalid json more gracefully
* Collect the following file:
Please check the log file [/home/ec2-user/.rally/benchmarks/races/2017-01-25-13-54-28/local/logs/rally_out.log] for further details first.


Jan 24th:
* DONE: Fixed bug where instance was being destroyed on failure despite --save_instance_on_failure
* DONE: data_file.json no longer will run by default. it is meant to be an example.
* DONE: removed files not needed (test_es_endpoint.py and endpoints.txt)


Jan 15th, 2017 Jon, Michael, Alex
* DONE: On failure, save instance (add option).
* DONE: removed "Failing tests message"
* DONE: Fix requirement for /tmp/es_rally_output.txt
* DONE: rename "set1" to something more meaningful.
  * DONE: add better documentation around what runs in parallel.
* DONE: comment out (deprecate) of non-data driven code in __main__
* Output last X lines of esrally via a verbosity flag.
  * Verbosity flag should specify amount of output from script to help debug issues.
* DONE: Do not use the tmp directory on the remote machine.
* DONE: Script should fail when disk space reaches 100%
* DONE: Describe how things run in parallel via threads.
  * Describe (maybe an image?) on flow of code
* DONE: Add a run/don't_run option in json!
* DONE: What if rally config does not exist? What is the error code? Error code is in copy_install_scripts (failed to copy file)
* DONE: Can we remove python3/ansible/pip3
* Download specific version of ES/Marvel


Jan 8th, 2017, Jon, Michael, Alex
* Test version 4 (currently using version 3)
    * Version 4 should detect hangs in rally.
    * Version 4 should should detect disk space.
    * Version 4 runs multiple instances.
* We should be able to run hundreds of test instances.
* Test results should output to an ES cluster.
* Next Iteration of Project:
  * Benchmarks against various products (splunk being more realistic)
  * Modify tracks and cars in rally (tracks are just config files).
    * Rally indexes THEN searches.
    * We should search (dense vs sparse) WHILE indexing.
      * Continue doubling until reach saturation.
      * If 256 caches, do 300 unique searches.
    * Tracks may support this scenario.
    * In Splunk benchmarking "needle in the haystack search".
    * 2 types: word vs aggregate search
  * Use pre-built ES cluster to test against.
    * Install Marvel plugin
* Code Updates:
  * Add "how to run the script" in the readme.
  * How the script works under the covers:
    * 22 ports
    * 0.0.0.0 security
    * id_rsa keys
    * how the script knows when it is done.
    * README needs prerequists: python 2.7 minimum, pip, awscli (installed via pip)
