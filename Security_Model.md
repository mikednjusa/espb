# Security for ES Rally Benchmarking

Recommendation for security would be for the benchmarking cluster to have its own VPC, public and private subnets and security group. This way the cluster is isolated and will not affect or be affected by other applications around it. The security group policy will be set to the minimum number of permissions: ec2, s3 access. IAM roles and instance profiles will also be created for further isolation. 

The controller/esrally and monitoring instance will be set in a public subnet so that Kibana can be reached. Because esrally and the controller need to reach Github, there is a potential security issue. This can be mitigated with setting up AWS ingress rules to restrict access, using only approved images as well as setting up Docker security measures such as control groups and namespaces. Whitelisting files and executables can also be implemented if necessary.

The benchmarking instances will be put in a private subnet. Further security can be applied to the Elasticsearch cluster by adding passwords and data encryption using X-Pack. However, I think this may be unnecessary as the elastic search cluster is isolated via a private subnet. 

The Cloudformation stack will handle the setting up and tearing down of the networking components. And because it is small and simple and intended to be torn down after testing, it should not add to the overhead of anyoneâ€™s system. The stack will create the bucket if it does not exist and a deletion policy will be put in place so that the bucket is not deleted when the stack is. 

Another reason for wanting to set up a separate VPC is because it allows us to set the IPs for the elasticsearch nodes. This is necessary in order to create a cluster on separate ec2 instances as in order to connect the nodes they need to know the IP of the other node.
